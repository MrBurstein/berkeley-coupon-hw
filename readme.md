### Will a Customer Accept the Coupon?

**Well, it depends!**

The likelihood of a customer accepting a coupon seems to correlate with:
- Income
- Marital status
- Type of passenger 
- Age

**Summary of Assigned Coursework:**

I hypothesize that individuals who typically accept bar coupons are drivers whose passengers are usually not kids, and are typically not widowed, often under the age of 30. In other words, individuals fitting this description are more likely to accept the coupon.

**Summary of my Preferred Activity: Coffee!**

After analyzing bar-related preferences, I explored the acceptance rates for coffee enthusiasts. To my surprise, individuals who are not widowed, drink coffee more than once a month, and have non-kid passengers, show an astronomically high acceptance rate of 99.17%.

**Quick Facts**

Highest acceptance rates for each column type:
- No Urgent Place: 63.38%
- Friend(s): 67.34%
- Sunny: 59.48%
- 2PM: 66.15%
- Carry out & Take away: 73.55%
- 1d: 62.56%
- Male: 59.08%
- Below 21: 63.44%
- Single: 60.59%
- Some High School: 71.59%
- Healthcare Support: 69.83%
- $50,000 - $62,499: 59.55%

**Conclusion**

I recommend our business teams target individuals fitting our ideal consumer profile: not widowed, engaging in their preferred activity, and without kids. This rule of thumb, applied to any coupon type, is likely to yield great benefits.
